Problem Statement



Ragul wants to write a program that performs a specific operation on a binary tree. The program should take an array of elements as input and construct a binary tree. Once the tree is constructed, the program should reverse the alternate levels of the binary tree. Finally, it should print the in-order traversal of the modified tree.

Input format :
The first line will contain an integer n, representing the number of elements in the array.

The second line will contain n space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array.

Output format :
The output will be a single line containing the elements of the binary tree after reversing the alternate levels, displayed in the in-order traversal. The elements should be separated by spaces.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 <= n <= 10

1 <= array elements <= 1000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
4 
1 2 3 4
Output 1 :
4 3 1 2
